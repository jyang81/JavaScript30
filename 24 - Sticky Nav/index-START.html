    <p>Now this is a story all about how
    My life got flipped-turned upside down
    And I'd like to take a minute
    Just sit right there
    I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air</p>
    
    <p>In west Philadelphia born and raised
    On the playground was where I spent most of my days
    Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
    And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
    When a couple of guys who were up to no good
    Started making trouble in my neighborhood
    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
    She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"</p>
    
    <p>I begged and pleaded with her day after day
    But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
    She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
    I put my Walkman on and said
    "I might as well kick it"</p>
    
    <p>First class, yo, this is bad
    Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
    Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
    Hmm, this might be alright</p>
    
    <p>But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
    Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
    I don't think so
    I'll see when I get there
    I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air</p>
    
    <p>Well, the plane landed and when I came out
    There was a dude who looked like a cop
    Standing there with my name out
    I ain't trying to get arrested yet
    I just got here
    I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared</p>
    
    <p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near
    The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
    If anything I could say that this cab was rare
    But I thought, "Nah, forget it"
    – "Yo, home to Bel-Air"</p>
    
    <p>I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
    And I yelled to the cabbie
    "Yo home smell ya later"
    I looked at my kingdom
    I was finally there
    To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air</p>

    <p>Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale, a tale of a fateful trip
    That started from this tropic port, aboard this tiny ship
    The mate was a mighty sailing man, the skipper brave and sure
    Five passengers set sail that day, on a three-hour tour
    A three-hour tour</p>
    <p>The weather started getting rough, the tiny ship was tossed
    If not for the courage of the fearless crew the Minnow would be lost
    The Minnow would be lost</p>
    <p>The ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle
    With Gilligan, the Skipper too
    The millionaire and his wife
    The movie star, Professor and Mary Ann
    Here on Gilligan's Isle</p>
    <p>So this is the tale of our castaways, they're here for a long, long time
    They'll have to make the best of things, and it's an uphill climb
    The first mate and his skipper too will do their very best
    To make the others comfortable, in the tropic island nest
    No phones, no lights, no motor cars, not a single luxury
    Like Robinson Crusoe, it's primitive as can be
    So join us here each week my friend, you're sure to get a smile
    From seven stranded Castaways, here on Gilligan's Isle</p>
    <p>Yeah it's Gilligan, the Skipper too
      The millionaire and his wife
      The movie star, professor and Mary Ann
      Here on Gilligan's Isle</p>

      <p>A record-breaking surge in U.S. coronavirus cases is being driven to a significant degree by casual occasions that may
      feel deceptively safe, officials and scientists warn — dinner parties, game nights, sleepovers and carpools.
      
      Many earlier coronavirus clusters were linked to nursing homes and crowded nightclubs. But public health officials
      nationwide say case investigations are increasingly leading them to small, private social gatherings. This behind-doors
      transmission trend reflects pandemic fatigue and widening social bubbles, experts say — and is particularly insidious
      because it is so difficult to police and likely to increase as temperatures drop and holidays approach.
      
      The White House coronavirus task force has been urging states that are virus hot spots to curtail maskless get-togethers
      of family and friends, saying in reports that asymptomatic attendees “cause ongoing transmission, frequently infecting
      multiple people in a single gathering.”
      
      As new daily cases in the United States surpassed 145,000 on Wednesday, New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced
      a 10-person limit on gatherings in private homes, calling them a “great spreader.” Similar restrictions have been
      imposed in states including Ohio, Utah, Connecticut and Colorado, where one recent cluster involved seven people
      infected while playing the dice game bunco, and Rhode Island, whose governor has pledged to fine violators.</p>

    <p>Here's the story of a lovely lady
    Who was bringing up three very lovely girls
    All of them had hair of gold, like their mother,
    The youngest one in curls
    Here's the story, of a man named Brady,
    Who was busy with three boys of his own,
    They were four men, living all together,
    Yet they were all alone
    'Till the one day when the lady met this fellow
    And they knew it was much more than a hunch,
    That this group would somehow form a family
    That's the way we all became the Brady Bunch
    The Brady Bunch, the Brady Bunch
    That's the way we all became the Brady Bunch.</p>

    <p>There's a guy like me in every state and federal prison in America, I guess--I'm
    the guy who can get it for you. Tailor made cigarettes, a bag of reefer if you're
    partial to that, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your son or daughter's high
    school graduation, or anything else within reason, that is. It wasn't always that way.
    I came to Shawshank when I was just twenty, and I am one of the few people in
    our happy little family willing to own up to what he did. I committed murder. I
    put a large insurance policy on my wife -- who was three years older than I was --
    and then I fixed the brakes on the Chevrolet coupe her father had given us as a
    wedding present. It worked out exactly as I had planned -- except I hadn't planned
    on her stopping to pick up the neighbor woman and the neighbor woman’s infant son
    on their way down Castle Hill and into town. The brakes let go and the car
    crashed through the bushes at the edge of the town common, gathering speed.
    Bystanders said it must have been doing fifty or better when it hit the base of
    the Civil War statue and burst into flames.</p>
